  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ECMO offers an acceptable cardiopulmonary support in adults with similar hospital survival
      rates as other mechanical support. It is versatile and salvages some patients, who may
      otherwise die. Improvement in intermediate term outcome will require multidisciplinary
      approach to protect organ function and limit organ injury during this support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an established treatment option in patients
      with Cardiogenic Schock. We retrospectively reviewed early and mid-term outcome as well as
      predictors of survival during using ECMO. This report reviews our experience with this
      support system in last 3 years.
