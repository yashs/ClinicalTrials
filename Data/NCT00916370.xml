      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the XIENCE PRIME and XIENCE PRIME Long Lesion
      (LL) Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (EECSS) in improving coronary luminal diameter
      in subjects with symptomatic heart disease due to a maximum of two de novo native coronary
      artery lesions, each in a different epicardial vessel.

         11. Subject will require Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) post-procedure.

         12. Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin,
             heparin/bivalirudin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, everolimus, cobalt, chromium, nickel,
             tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers or contrast sensitivity that cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated.

         13. Elective surgery is planned within 12 months after the procedure that will require
             discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel.

         14. Subject has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3, a white
             blood cell (WBC) of &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3, or documented or suspected liver disease
             (including laboratory evidence of hepatitis).

         15. Subject has known renal insufficiency (examples being but not limited to estimated
             glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 ml/kg/m2, serum creatinine level ≥ 2.5 mg/dL,
             or on dialysis).

         16. Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions.

         20. Subject has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known
             history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause
             non-compliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated
             with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year).

         21. Subject is currently participating in another clinical study that has not yet
             completed its primary endpoint.

             vessel (e.g. atherectomy, cutting balloon).

         13. Target vessel is previously treated with any type of PCI (e.g. balloon angioplasty,
             stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) &lt; 9 months prior to index procedure.

         14. Non-target vessel is previously treated with any type of PCI &lt; 90 days prior to the
             index procedure.

         15. Additional clinically significant lesion(s) (e.g. %DS ≥ 50%) in a target vessel or
             side branch for which PCI may be required &lt; 90 days after the index procedure.
